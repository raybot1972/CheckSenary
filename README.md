# Fix Senary Audio Mic via Jack 🎧🛠

This Python GUI tool helps diagnose and fix microphone issues caused by misclassified audio drivers—specifically targeting **SenaryAudio** extensions that incorrectly detect headset jacks as output-only. It automates the process of purging problematic INF drivers and restoring proper mic functionality.

## 🔍 Features

- Lists installed drivers filtered by provider (e.g., "Senary")
- Allows selective purging of INF files via GUI
- Automates `pnputil` commands with logging
- Saves detailed logs of all actions
- Designed for Windows systems with admin privileges

---

## 🖥 Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8+
- Admin rights (required for driver removal)
- Dependencies:
  - `tkinter` (standard with Python)
  - `subprocess`, `re`, `datetime` (built-in)

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-purge-tool.git
   cd driver-purge-tool
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python driver_purge_gui.py
   ```

4. Select INF files associated with **SenaryAudio** and purge them safely.

## 🧠 Why This Tool?

SenaryAudio drivers often misclassify combo jacks, locking out microphone input while still allowing loopback monitoring. This tool helps reclaim mic functionality by removing legacy extension drivers that override Windows' native audio stack.

## 📁 Output

- Logs are saved to the current directory with timestamped filenames:
  ```
  DriverPurgeLog_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
  ```

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Use with caution. Removing drivers may affect audio functionality. Always verify selected INF files before purging. This tool is intended for advanced users and system optimizers.
